This repo contains a basic API using ASP.NET, with the primary purpose of 
learning practical implementations of various features expected of production systems.

This repo will focus on including compact implementations of these features 
(Authentication, DB interaction, automatic documentation etc) 
as its primary focus, taking priority over having a fully fleshed out set of endpoints.

[*notes.md*](notes.md) will be used as a place to keep track of any important processes for administration and other 
requirements that are necessary but can be either more complex to implement or take longer to research than other subjects 
(key generation for JWTs, many-to-many relationships using ORMs etc).
